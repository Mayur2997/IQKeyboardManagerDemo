# IQKeyboardManagerDemo
While developing iOS apps, we often run into issues where the iPhone keyboard slides up and covers the UITextField/UITextView. IQKeyboardManager allows you to prevent this issue of keyboard sliding up and covering UITextField/UITextView without needing you to write any code or make any additional setup. To use IQKeyboardManager you simply need to add source files to your project.

Key Features
CODELESS, Zero Lines of Code, Works Automatically, No More UIScrollView, No More Subclasses, No More Manual Work, No More #imports

IQKeyboardManager works on all orientations, and with the toolbar. It also has nice optional features allowing you to customize the distance from the text field, behaviour of previous, next and done buttons in the keyboard toolbar, play sound when the user navigates through the form and more.
